#Malware Search Engine (MSE)
#Overview
The Malware Search Engine (MSE) was developed as a proof-of-concept for a Final Year Project. Its main goal is to highlight the importance of accessible malware resources for students and researchers in cybersecurity. Given the challenges of manually searching for malware samples online, MSE aims to demonstrate how a centralized resource can significantly benefit those entering the field.

Due to the time constraints of the academic timeline, this project primarily emphasizes the concept of streamlined malware access. As a POC, it does not include a fully integrated workflow across all phases involved in a production-level malware search platform.

#Motivation
The main motivation behind MSE is to support the learning and research processes in malware analysis. By centralizing malware samples, MSE not only decreases search time but also creates a structured environment for more effective and organized exploration of malware. Users can customize their search parameters to find relevant samples that align with their specific research needs, making the process more efficient and productive.

#Features
Centralized Database: Access a wide variety of malware samples in one place, eliminating the need for multiple searches across the internet.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use, especially for those new to malware analysis and cybersecurity.
Customizable Search Options: Tailor search parameters to find samples that match specific research requirements, improving accuracy and relevancy.

#Installation
Requires Cuckoo Sandbox (has been undergoing major functionality revamps for a while but can't wait FOR IT to be back!!)
MongoDB
Python

Below is how we always planned the workflow of the entire MSE would look like:
